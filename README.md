## Project Description
Vision Vanguards aims to develop an integrated karaoke and movement web application, combining computer vision and audio processing technologies. The project involves implementing gesture and full-body skeletal tracking, alongside audio processing for lyrical pitch accuracy. The team has completed initial research, environment setup, and technology selection for the web interface. The envisioned outcome includes a fully functional platform with accurate scoring for singing and dance movements, a comprehensive lyrics module, and user management features. The project's success relies on the seamless execution of key tasks, including technology implementation and interface optimization.

## User Interface Specification

Functionality: 
- A user can sign up/login for the web application either using an email and password, or sign in through Google.
- A user can view the leaderboard that shows the top 5 scorers of the game, including details like their high score, the number of games played and tags associated with their performance.
- A user can also view their specific ranking and how they compare to others in the same league.
- A user can sign out/delete their own account.
- A user can start an audio performance, with a preview to check whether audio is functional. Once the performance starts, the user is able to view lyrics.
- Alternatively, a user can start an audio-video performance where they can follow along with lyrics while posing.
- Once the performance ends, a user can view their comprehensive score and their scores in various categories including posing, lyrics and pitch. They can also restart the performance, or view updates to the leaderboard.

User Interaction:
- Users can navigate the website using a combination of mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
- Interactive elements such as buttons and links should provide visual feedback when clicked.
- Forms should validate user input in real-time and display error messages if necessary.

Visual Design Guides:
- The website will use a modern and clean design aesthetic.
- Color scheme: Predominantly blues, pinks and blacks and white.
- Typography: Rubix Mono for headings and Cousine for body text.

UI Design Mockups can be viewed on our Figma. Here are some screenshots of the app illustrating the color scheme, layout and some functionality:
