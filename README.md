## Project Description
Vision Vanguards aims to develop an integrated karaoke and movement web application, combining computer vision and audio processing technologies. The project involves implementing gesture and full-body skeletal tracking, alongside audio processing for lyrical pitch accuracy. The team has completed initial research, environment setup, and technology selection for the web interface. The envisioned outcome includes a fully functional platform with accurate scoring for singing and dance movements, a comprehensive lyrics module, and user management features. The project's success relies on the seamless execution of key tasks, including technology implementation and interface optimization.
