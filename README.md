## Project Description
Vision Vanguards aims to develop an integrated karaoke and movement web application, combining computer vision and audio processing technologies.

The team has completed initial research, environment setup, and technology selection for the web interface. The envisioned outcome includes a fully functional platform with accurate scoring for singing and dance movements, a comprehensive lyrics module, and user management features. The project's success relies on the seamless execution of key tasks, including technology implementation and interface optimization.
